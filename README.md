Website made from HTML / CSS

Develop and create an E-business site for a local bed and breakfast, hotel, or
other lodging venue in your community. The business can be real or fictional.
The website should include a company identity including a name, logo, and
brand. The website should have elements of a typical lodging facility
including contact information, the ability to make reservations, view different
room types, view amenities, and local attractions. Ensure that your Ebusiness site includes:
• An e-commerce tool showing prices for different lodging types
• A scheduling tool allowing customers to book lodging
• An API to an online map service showing different local attractions
